Farrow 0.6.0 defaults to Ubuntu 24.04 and improves the everyday loop of
planning, starting, expanding, and rebuilding a local Pigsty lab.

## What changed

- **Ubuntu 24.04 by default.** New inventories and the embedded catalog use
  `u24:stable`. Catalog revision `2026090501` also includes the Debian 12/13
  and Rocky Linux 8/9 updates already available in the official repositories.
- **Useful plans before setup.** `plan` works without QEMU or host networking
  installed and shows exact image versions, resource totals, pending starts,
  changed fields, disk effects, and commands that retain custom `-f` paths.
- **Readable status and errors.** Status shows images, CPU, and memory; one
  damaged node no longer hides healthy peers. Corrupt state names the actual
  file and cause. Image digest failures return exit 7; SSH exit 255 passes
  through unchanged. `--no-wait` clearly reports that readiness was skipped.
- **Checks before disruption.** Selected `recreate` detects conflicting peer
  changes before deleting disks. `reload` checks startup dependencies before
  stopping guests. Stop, destroy, and runtime cleanup handle deployment state
  consistently under the existing lock.
- **Guest names stay current.** Starting commands and node removal refresh
  Farrow-managed guest hosts entries and control-node SSH configuration.
  Recreated peers remain reachable without clearing guest `known_hosts`.
  User SSH text and global option scope are preserved.
- **Fewer CLI surprises.** Custom `init` paths produce usable next commands;
  presentation flags respect option values; malformed integer sizes and extra
  YAML documents are rejected without truncation. `ALL_PROXY`/`all_proxy`
  provides a fallback while respecting scheme-specific proxies and `NO_PROXY`.

## Upgrade notes

Upgrading Farrow does not replace existing disks or change an explicitly
selected image. If an old inventory relied on the implicit Debian 13 default,
add `vm_image: d13` under `all.vars` before applying it with 0.6.0. Review
`farrow plan` before applying changes; `farrow start` uses the applied state.

CPU and memory changes still use `recreate`: root and non-persistent data disks
are replaced, while persistent data disks are retained. `--no-wait` skips both
readiness and guest metadata refresh; a later `farrow up` completes them.
Scripts should use `--json` or `--yaml` instead of parsing status columns;
partial status results include healthy nodes and a `failures` array, with exit 5.

## Install or upgrade

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/pgsty/farrow/releases/download/v0.6.0/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
FARROW_VERSION=0.6.0 ./install.sh
farrow version
farrow doctor
```

The release also includes four platform archives, amd64/arm64 DEB and RPM
packages, and a Homebrew formula. As a pre-1.0 release it keeps the GitHub
pre-release flag, so the installer needs the explicit version above.
See the [Quick Start](https://farrow.pgsty.com/docs/start/tutorial/).

## Validation

The lifecycle and UX changes passed two adversarial Claude Code Fable 5.1
reviews at xhigh effort, plus the complete local `make check` gate. An isolated
macOS arm64/HVF lab exercised Ubuntu 24.04 boot, scale-out, control-to-peer SSH,
stop/start, reload, recreate, partial status failures, and scale-in. The final
guest SSH scope correction also passed effective OpenSSH configuration tests.

The tag workflow repeats source checks and verifies archives, packages, SBOMs,
installer, formula, release metadata, and checksums. These checks do not imply
a new Linux-host VM replay, host-reboot test, or complete Pigsty installation.

Farrow began with a familiar VM-manager abstraction: a working directory was
a project, a hidden marker gave it identity, a registry found projects again,
and a host-global lease kept their private networks from colliding. That model
can support many independent VM sets. It was also the wrong model for the
product Farrow was actually becoming.

The target is not a general-purpose hypervisor front end. It is one local,
fixed-IP Pigsty lab. The operator already has a complete description of that
lab: the Pigsty Inventory. Adding a second VM manifest and a second project
identity made every ordinary question harder.

The old abstraction turned ordinary questions into project-management
questions:

- Which file is authoritative for a node's name and address?
- Does moving a directory move the lab or create a new one?
- What happens when the marker survives but the registry does not?
- Is a missing directory an abandoned project or an unavailable disk?
- Which project owns the one host network?

Those are legitimate multi-project questions. Farrow chose to stop creating
them.

## One Inventory is enough

The Inventory handed to Pigsty is also Farrow's desired state. Farrow reads a
small, documented boundary: host addresses, a few Pigsty-native identity
fields, and the `vm_*` namespace. Validation is strict inside that namespace;
the rest of the Inventory stays opaque and passes to Pigsty untouched.

This asymmetric rule matters. A misspelled `vm_mem` must fail because it would
change the machine Farrow builds. A new PostgreSQL tuning parameter must not
fail merely because the VM layer has never heard of it. The same file can
therefore evolve as a Pigsty Inventory without becoming a second Farrow
format in disguise.

Names follow the same principle. A node uses `nodename` when present, then a
stable Pigsty cluster/sequence derivation, then its address suffix. Farrow does
not add a parallel `vm_name` that can disagree with the hostname Pigsty sees.

## One owner-scoped state root

Applied state lives under `FARROW_HOME`, normally `~/.farrow`. There is no
marker in the working directory and no per-directory registry. Commands that
operate on applied state can run from any directory; commands that propose new
desired state discover or receive an Inventory explicitly.

This is an owner-scoped deployment, not a root-enforced machine-wide
singleton. Each Unix user has an independent state root. Farrow is intended
for a trusted development workstation, not hostile-user arbitration on a
shared server.

The simplification has practical consequences:

- moving or renaming the source directory does not move deployment identity;
- losing the Inventory does not erase the applied state;
- removing one state root removes Farrow's user-owned footprint, apart from
  separately managed host networking and hosts-file entries;
- image cache, keys, nodes, disks, locks, and deployment state share one
  inspectable boundary instead of being spread across project registries.

## Configuration absence is not intent

One deployment does **not** mean the Inventory is disposable. It means Farrow
can distinguish desired configuration from applied evidence. When a command
needs desired state, an existing deployment can supply its applied spec where
the command contract allows that fallback. A missing file is never interpreted
as a request to remove nodes.

That rule survives every layer of the lifecycle: [planning and deletion stay
explicit](/blog/design/convergence-without-surprise/), and recovery preserves
ambiguous resources instead of guessing what the user meant.

## The trade-off is deliberate

Farrow does not support multiple concurrent deployments per user. Projects,
registries, and address-level leasing are not hidden future features; they
were rejected because they would reintroduce the abstraction the product
removed.

If the requirement changes to multi-tenant or multi-host orchestration, that
is a different product boundary. For a local Pigsty lab, one Inventory and one
deployment make the important things—addresses, ownership, drift, recovery,
and cleanup—much easier to explain and prove.

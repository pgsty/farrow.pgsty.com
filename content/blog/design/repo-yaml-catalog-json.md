A static image repository sounds like a directory of qcow2 files plus a JSON
index. The difficult part is deciding which facts a maintainer may write by
hand and which facts must be derived from the bytes being published.

If checksums and sizes live in the hand-authored source, they are easy to copy
incorrectly. If policy exists only in generated JSON, reviewing a channel
change or deprecation requires reading machine output. Farrow keeps the two
jobs separate.

## `repo.yaml`: what the maintainer means

The source-controlled `repo.yaml` contains author intent:

- repository revision and defaults;
- image families and aliases;
- movable channels such as `stable`;
- exact versions and architectures;
- boot mode and support status;
- immutable upstream locations and provenance notes.

It deliberately does **not** contain generated artifact size, SHA-256, or
virtual size. A compact entry can say that `d13:stable` points to one exact
version with amd64 and arm64 variants without pretending to know facts that
belong to the files:

```yaml
defaults: { image: d13, channel: stable, arch: native, boot: uefi }
images:
  d13:
    aliases: [debian13, debian, trixie]
    channels: { stable: "20260810.2566.0" }
    versions:
      "20260810.2566.0":
        status: supported
        variants:
          amd64: {}
          arm64: {}
```

This is the right layer for review: a pull request can show that a channel
moved, a version was deprecated, or a provenance statement changed.

## `catalog.json`: what the repository can prove

`catalog.json` materializes policy against the local repository. For every
variant it records the exact filename, byte count, SHA-256, qcow2 virtual size,
boot contract, source user, and immutable upstream fallback.

Those fields come from scanning the artifact, not from copying values out of
the YAML. Build forces qcow2 parsing, rejects backing files, external data,
encryption, and unknown incompatible features, and runs structural checks
before atomically replacing the Catalog.

The artifact identity is the tuple `(image, exact version, architecture)`, not
the channel that selected it. Files keep readable immutable names:

```text
images/d13-20260810.2566.0-arm64.qcow2
```

Readable names are an operational feature: an administrator can inspect,
mirror, or recover a repository with ordinary filesystem tools. Integrity
still comes from generated metadata and verification, not from trusting the
name.

## Three operations, three responsibilities

The repository CLI keeps observation, generation, and proof separate:

| Command | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `farrow repo scan` | report tracked, missing, untracked, or unsafe artifacts without changing anything |
| `farrow repo build` | validate source and artifacts, then atomically materialize the Catalog |
| `farrow repo verify` | rebuild the materialization in memory and require byte-for-byte equality with the published Catalog |

`build` never edits `repo.yaml` or qcow2 bytes. `verify` is stronger than
“every checksum is valid”: it also proves that no source policy or artifact
change was omitted from the generated Catalog.

Publication follows the same direction. Upload immutable image bytes first;
publish the Catalog and its signature last. A client can then see either the
old complete repository view or the new complete view, not a Catalog that
advertises bytes still in transit.

## Selectors may move; artifacts may not

Human configuration needs convenient selectors. `d13:stable`, `el9@9`, and
`el9@9.7` can resolve to newer exact versions as the repository evolves.
Numeric prefixes compare dot-separated components as integers, so 9.10 sorts
after 9.9.

After resolution, the client persists the exact version, architecture, size,
and digest. An already resolved node does not become a different machine
because a channel moves. Convenience exists at selection time; immutable
identity exists at execution time.

## Transport and trust are different questions

Official and plain-HTTP Catalogs require a trusted detached signature. An
operator who explicitly selects a local directory or HTTPS repository may use
an unsigned Catalog because local ownership or authenticated transport is the
explicit trust decision. An implicit compiled default remains in the signed
trust domain even if its URL is HTTPS.

Accepted Catalog state is tracked independently per repository. Farrow rejects
unknown keys, a revision below that repository's high-water mark, and different
bytes at the same revision. An explicit downgrade is visible and scoped to the
selected repository; resetting to the embedded Catalog does not erase the
anti-rollback record.

Catalog acceptance is only the first half. Every pull still checks byte count,
SHA-256, and qcow2 structure. Verified base images become read-only, and node
root disks are overlays, so normal VM writes never mutate the trusted base.

## Separate trust domains stay separate

Image Catalog keys authorize image policy. Release signing proves the Farrow
application artifacts and checksum manifest. The two key sets are intentionally
independent: permission to publish a VM image must not imply permission to ship
a new Farrow binary, or vice versa.

Ordinary public builds also compile no private development mirror as a default.
They begin with the embedded Catalog and its immutable HTTPS upstream URLs. A
public mirror can become a compiled default only after the mirror itself is
live. Source configuration, generated Catalog, uploaded artifacts, signing,
and public availability remain separate release gates.

That is the larger design principle: policy should be pleasant to review, but
facts about shipped bytes should be generated, reproducible, and independently
verifiable.

A Pigsty Inventory names machines by stable addresses. PostgreSQL replication,
etcd membership, HAProxy backends, VIPs, monitoring targets, and Ansible all
assume that `10.10.10.11` continues to mean the same node. A loopback port
forward can expose SSH or PostgreSQL to the host, but it cannot provide that
network identity to peers.

This is why Farrow does not choose between a convenient NAT mode and an
advanced fixed-network mode. Every normal node gets both jobs, on separate
interfaces.

## One interface should not do two incompatible jobs

| Interface | Addressing | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| management | QEMU user-mode NAT, DHCP | DNS, default route, outbound internet, and loopback SSH fallback |
| `private0` | fixed Inventory address | host-to-node, node-to-node, Ansible, Pigsty services, and VIP traffic |

The management interface is deliberately ordinary. It lets a new cloud image
reach package repositories before any application exists, without installing
NAT rules or a DHCP service on the host.

The private interface is deliberately boring. It has one deterministic
RFC1918 address, no default route, and no DNS. The guest ready marker is not
written until that exact address is present and the unwanted route and DNS
state are absent. A node that can reach the internet but is wrong on the lab
network is not “mostly ready.”

## The Inventory owns the address plan

All managed hosts belong to one canonical RFC1918 `/24`:

| Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `.1` | host side of the private network |
| `.2`–`.8` | reserved boundary, including valid L2 VIP space |
| `.9`–`.254` | fixed node addresses |

There is no DHCP server on the private side. Cloud-init receives the exact
address already declared in the Inventory. That removes a second address
database and makes the first Ansible connection use the same identity as every
later deployment.

For generated configuration, setup can choose from a small bounded set when
the default subnet is already occupied. An explicitly supplied Inventory is
never silently rewritten to escape a collision. The whole lab—host interface,
nodes, Pigsty addresses, and aliases—must agree on one subnet.

## Platform-specific backend, identical guest contract

The guest sees the same topology on every supported host, while Farrow follows
the host's native networking owner:

- **macOS:** a pinned `socket_vmnet` service provides the private link. Host
  mode is the default; shared mode is explicit. QEMU still runs as the user.
- **Linux with active NetworkManager:** Farrow creates an owned `farrow0`
  bridge through `nmcli` and integrates with active firewalld policy.
- **Linux with systemd-networkd:** Farrow installs owned units and uses the
  distribution `qemu-bridge-helper` so QEMU remains unprivileged.
- **Inactive networkd:** activation is allowed only after a pre-mutation scan
  proves that existing units cannot claim a real host interface.

Supporting both Linux managers is not abstraction for its own sake. Starting
networkd on a desktop or RHEL-family host merely because Farrow knows how to
write `.network` files can disrupt the host's real network. The backend must
follow the component already in charge.

## Host networking is a transaction

A bridge or vmnet daemon outlives one CLI process and crosses a privilege
boundary, so Farrow treats installation as a reversible host transaction:

1. inspect routes, interfaces, services, ownership, and existing state;
2. print the exact plan before mutation;
3. re-check the preconditions immediately before apply;
4. write root-owned state describing what Farrow created and what existed
   before it;
5. prove an unprivileged QEMU attachment;
6. accept the installation only after readiness checks pass.

A foreign interface that happens to use the same `.1/24` is not adopted. A
modified owned file is not overwritten. Uninstall refuses while recorded nodes
are live and restores only the prestate named by the manifest. Failure is a
reason to stop, not permission to delete whatever appears to be in the way.

## The accepted trade-off

Guest internet traffic uses QEMU's user-mode network. That is not the fastest
possible forwarding path, but it keeps ordinary egress unprivileged and
portable. The traffic that matters to a Pigsty lab—host-to-guest, replication,
service calls, and package distribution from a local control node—stays on the
private link.

The result is a useful separation of concerns: the management NIC makes a
machine easy to bootstrap; the private NIC makes it a stable member of the
lab. Neither has to pretend to be the other.

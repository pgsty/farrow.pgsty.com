With Farrow installed, new users can start a test lab with the [Quick Start](tutorial/):

```bash
farrow up
farrow ssh
```

When no inventory or deployment exists, interactive `up` creates the default
inventory. It can prepare missing host dependencies and networking. Repeat `farrow up` to retry unfinished guest setup without
restarting healthy VMs. For unattended setup, run `farrow setup --yes` before
`farrow up`.

Package availability is recorded on [Status](../about/status/); developers and
source reviewers can use [Build from Source](source-build/).

Everything else is separated by task:

1. [Daily Operations](operations/) — status, access, start/stop, changes,
   scale-in, and destroy.
2. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/) — diagnostics and common fixes.
3. [Image Repositories](images/) — choose images, use mirrors, import, and
   prune the cache.
4. [Build from Source](source-build/) — developer builds, checks, and local
   PATH setup.
5. [Uninstall and Clean Up](uninstall/) — remove the deployment, images,
   networking, and state.
